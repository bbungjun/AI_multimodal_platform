# Current Work Handoff

This file is the shared handoff point for working on this repository from more
than one machine. Read it after `AGENTS.md` and before making changes. Update it
at the end of every meaningful work session.

## Workspace Rule

- Treat the current checkout directory as the repository root.
- Do not write machine-specific absolute paths into committed docs.
- Use repo-relative paths in docs and commands whenever possible.
- Keep `.env`, credential files, generated media, local Docker volumes,
  virtualenvs, `node_modules`, and runtime logs local to each machine.
- Use `.env.example` as the shared template and each machine's `.env` as local
  state.

## Current Project State

- Repository: `bbungjun/AI_multimodal_platform`
- Default branch: `main`
- Default local mode: `AI_PROVIDER=mock`
- Runtime shape: Docker Compose runs `db`, `redis`, `backend`, `dispatcher`,
  `frontend`, and `worker`.
- Job dispatch shape: API writes jobs and outbox events to Postgres; dispatcher
  publishes `job_id` to Redis/Celery; Celery worker claims jobs from Postgres.
- Source of truth for user-visible job state: Postgres, not Redis or Celery
  result state.

## Machine Setup Notes

For a new laptop or desktop checkout:

```powershell
git pull
.\scripts\setup_local.ps1
```

Run the full local quality gate when dependencies are installed:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup_local.ps1 -RunVerify
```

Adjust `.env` only for local machine needs. In mock mode, leave credential
values empty. In Vertex mode, configure credentials locally and never commit or
paste credential contents.

## Last Completed Work

As of 2026-06-10, the documentation was aligned with the current
Redis/Celery/outbox runtime and the shared multi-machine workflow:

- Updated README architecture and mock-mode env example to include Redis,
  dispatcher, Celery worker, and outbox settings.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to describe the current Compose services and require this
  handoff file.
- Updated `docs/production-worker-queue-plan.md` so it reads as migration
  history plus next operational work, not as a stale pre-Phase-2 plan.
- Removed committed machine-specific repository paths from Markdown files.
- Cleaned smoke-run documentation so already-running service lists include
  Redis alongside `db`, `backend`, `dispatcher`, `worker`, and `frontend` where
  applicable.
- Added `scripts/setup_local.ps1` so laptop/desktop checkouts can create a local
  `.env` from `.env.example` without overwriting existing local settings, verify
  Compose config, and optionally run the full quality gate with `-RunVerify`.

## Next Suggested Work

- Use `scripts/setup_local.ps1` after switching machines or after a fresh clone.
  Pass `-RunVerify` when local Python/Node dependencies are installed and you
  want the full quality gate. Pass `-Force` only when intentionally regenerating
  `.env` from `.env.example`.
- Consider adding a short README link to this handoff file if future agents miss
  it despite the `AGENTS.md` rule.
- Run the full local quality gate before committing documentation changes:

```powershell
python scripts/verify_local.py
```

## Verification Log

Latest documentation-focused checks:

```powershell
git diff --check
git status --short --branch
$env:AI_PROVIDER='mock'; python -m pytest tests/test_setup_local_script.py -q
.\scripts\setup_local.ps1
```

Expected:

- no machine-specific absolute repository path remains in Markdown after a
  targeted search for the old laptop/desktop checkout paths
- no whitespace errors
- only intentional working-tree changes are present
